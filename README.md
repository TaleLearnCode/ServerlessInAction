# Serverless in Action

<!-- ![Event-Driven Architecture in the Cloud](https://chadgreen.blob.core.windows.net/slides/Event%20Driven%20Architecture%20in%20the%20Cloud.jpg) -->

## Abstract
Have you ever needed the ability to develop something simple for a business request but did not want to go through the trouble of creating a full application?  Well, that is where Azure Functions comes into play.  Azure Functions provides a serverless computer service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.  Literally, within a couple of minutes, you can develop a function that can perform critical business need using the development languages you already use.

During this session, we will walk through some real-world examples using C# and JavaScript that will allow you to back and start using this great service right away.

## Short Abstract
Have you ever needed the ability to develop something simple for a business request but did not want to go through the trouble of creating a full application?  Serverless computing will help you do that quickly and without the mess and fuss of dealing with infrastructure.

## Elevator Pitch
Learn how to develop business-critical functionality within minutes using the development language you already use.

## Why You Should Attend Session
All to often, software developers get one off requirements for business-critical functionality that require implementing infrastructure that now will have to be maintained.  Serverless development makes this much easier as the cloud vendor handles all of the server administration.  Plus, using something like Azure Functions will greatly improve development speed with its many triggers and bindings.  In this session, you will learn what is serverless development with an emphasis on Azure Functions and how you can use these technologies to quickly build business-critical functionality.
